                    College students tend to find working with groups to be a tedious process. Finding
people who are struggling with the same problems as each other is difficult and finding
those who are willing to put in the effort is even more difficult. We intend to make these
difficulties disappear with our app/website. Searching for peers with similar majors,
levels of expertise, and willingness to work will be an ease with the utilization of our app.
